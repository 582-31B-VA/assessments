# Exam 2

> Weigth: 10%\
> Due: October 6

For this exam, your task is to design and implement three classes for an
online ordering system: `Order`, `Item` and `Status`. Each order has a
`status` (initially "processing", then "shipped" or "delivered"), and a
list of `items` provided when the order is created. Items have a `name`
and a `price`. The price is stored in cents and must be positive. In
addition to its `status` and `items`, we can get an order's `total` in
cents. We can also get a `status_message` that corresponds to its
current status. Here are the messages:

- We are processing your order.
- Your order has been shipped.
- Your order has been delivered.

Finally, record an 5â€“10 minutes video in which you explain how the
evaluation of the expression below unfolds according to the substitution
model covered in class.

```python
Item("Shirt", -100)
```

Your explanation should walk through the process step by step. Make sure
both your code and your face remain visible for the entire video.

## Starter files and submission

To access the starter files, first [accept the assignment][Classroom].
Then, clone your repository using `git clone <url>`, where `<url>` is
the link provided to you after accepting the assignment.

To submit your assignment, push your changes to the "main" branch on the
"origin" remote. Code pushed on other branches will not be assessed.
