# Exam 3

> Weigth: 10%\
> Due: October 27

In computing, a file system is a hierarchical tree structure made of
**nodes**, each with its unique **name**. **Files** _are_ nodes that can
store **content**, whereas **directories** _are_ nodes that can have
**children**, each of which is either a file or a directory node.

Your task for this exam is to model this structure using three classes:
`Node`, `File` and `Directory`. Nodes are considered equal only if their
name is identical (see the `__eq__` special method). At no point can two
child of a directory can be equal.

In addition, record an 5â€“10 minutes video in which you explain how the
evaluation of the expression below unfolds according to the substitution
model covered in class.

```python
File("greet.txt", "hello world").name
```

Your explanation should walk through the process step by step. Make sure
both your code and your face remain visible for the entire video.

## Starter files and submission

To access the starter files, first [accept the assignment][Classroom],
then clone the GitHub Classroom repository on your computer.

To submit your assignment, push your changes to the `main` branch on the
`origin` remote. Code pushed on other branches will not be assessed.
